# **MeLiDA**
 **Me**asure **LiDA**R System\
 https://ko-fi.com/melida

MeLiDA integrates LiDAR sensors with Blender to create professional surveys of buildings, structures, and their relics—built for architects, constructors, conservators of monuments, archaeologists and engineers.

This software is part of a project to create **chip professional solution** (software + hardware + DIY) for preserving cultural heritage in every corner of the world.

## Current features:
- **Live view** with point quality-based filtering
- **Making Point cloud group** from stations, with ON/OFF color scale visualization of point quality
- **Basic tools** for work on point cloud groups: rotation, move, deletion, etc.

It’s a **beta version**. It was developed to test is there a way to create lightweight, performance-friendly solution for visualizing and processing large point clouds without overloading Blender or hardware.  
Beta version of MeLiDA allowed us to check our concept:
- Stress-test Blender with massive point clouds
- Compare LiDAR accuracy against our photogrammetry scans
- Run real-world field scans (we use it daily in conservation work)

## **The future is here!**
(What’s next?)

We are currently field-testing version 1.0:
- Auto-alignment – Scans automatically match their real-world positions.
- Aligns new point clouds station to existing ones
- Drift correction – Minimizes alignment errors (our top priority).

## We need YOU!
https://ko-fi.com/melida

We won’t hide it—the development of this plugin depends on GitHub community’s interest and your financial support. Funds will be used to integrate additional LiDAR sensors (expanding the currently limited range of supported devices) and dramatically accelerate plugin development. Future goals:
- WiFi sensor integration
- 3D sensor integration
- Full automation of creating survey drawings (with dimension)
- and much more

All supporters will have a real influence on the plugin’s development—which sensors integrate next, what features add, etc.

## Compatible Devices:
Tested & Working:
- STL-19P LiDAR sensor (LDROBOT) + USB bridge – D500 LiDAR Kit
Should Work (Same Design) :
- STL-14P LiDAR sensor (Uses identical protocols. Remember about USB bridge!)
- Most LDROBOT sensors (Same data format; don’t forget about USB bridge!)
- more in the future!

## About Us:
We are heritage conservation architects (with 45 and 15 years of experience). We develop this software for ourselves and for you—so it’s truly field-tested and grounded in real-world working conditions ;)
